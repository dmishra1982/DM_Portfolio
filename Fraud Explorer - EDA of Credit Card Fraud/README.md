# Fraud Explorer - EDA of Credit Card Fraud

## Project Overview

<p align="justify">
  
This project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and trends in credit card fraud data. By exploring the distribution of fraudulent transactions, identifying correlations between features, and analyzing geographical and behavioral patterns, we aim to improve fraud detection strategies and enhance understanding of fraud indicators.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Anaconda**: Download and install Anaconda from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
2. **Open Anaconda Navigator**: Launch Anaconda Navigator from your application menu or command line.
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Click on the Jupyter Notebook icon in Anaconda Navigator to open it in your web browser.
4. **Create or Open a Notebook**: Create a new notebook or open an existing one to start working with Python.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset according to the guidelines in the Data section.
2. Train and evaluate the models as described in Model Training and Evaluation.
3. Analyze the results in the results section and plan improvements based on Future Work.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes simulated credit card transactions from January 2019 to December 2020, covering 1000 customers and 800 merchants.

### Source Data
The dataset is sourced from the [**Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection), available on Kaggle.

## Model Training and Evaluation
This project implements two machine learning models for fraud detection:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics.

## Results
The results of the model training are as follows:
- **Logistic Regression**: Achieved 92% accuracy.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved 97% accuracy, outperforming the Logistic Regression model.

## Future Work
Potential future improvements include:
- Enhancing model robustness for imbalanced datasets.
- Implementing real-time fraud detection capabilities.
- Exploring ensemble methods for improving model performance.
