# Telecom Churn Predicator: Predictive Analytics for Telecom Customer Retention

## Project Overview
In the competitive telecommunications industry, customer churn is a major challenge affecting profitability and customer loyalty. "Churn Shield" uses machine learning techniques to build predictive models that identify customers at risk of churning. This allows telecom companies to implement targeted retention strategies, minimize revenue loss, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Installation and Setup
To set up this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Anaconda**: Download and install Anaconda from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
2. **Open Anaconda Navigator**: Launch Anaconda Navigator from your application menu or command line.
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Click on the Jupyter Notebook icon within Anaconda Navigator to open it in your browser.
4. **Create or Open a Notebook**: Create a new notebook or open an existing one to start working with Python.

## Python Packages Used
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imbalanced-learn`

Make sure these packages are installed in your environment before running the project.

## Data

The dataset used contains detailed information on telecom customers, including:
- **Customer demographics**: gender, age, household composition.
- **Subscription details**: contract type, monthly charges, payment methods.
- **Customer interactions**: service calls, complaints, and more.

### Source Data
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle's Telecom Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics). Please download and place it in the appropriate directory in the project folder.

## Results and Evaluation

### Key Findings:
- **Month-to-month contracts** are more prone to churn compared to long-term contracts.
- There is **no strong correlation** between monthly charges and churn.
- **Payment methods** and **customer interactions** are key factors in predicting churn.

### Model Performance:
Several machine learning models were evaluated, and **Gradient Boosting** emerged as the best performer, achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy. The models were evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work
Potential enhancements for this project include:
- Implementing **advanced ensemble techniques** or **neural networks** for improved predictions.
- Incorporating **additional data sources**, such as customer satisfaction surveys.
- Deploying the predictive model into a **production environment** and continuously updating it with new data.
