    "In this project, the data consists of credit card transactions along with demographic information details such as merchant information, timestamps, and contextual features. The fraud labels indicate whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The objective is to gather data from the three sources, perform data cleaning and formatting, and generate user-defined fields as needed. Next, the relationships between the data sources will be established, and the data will be stored for further analysis. Finally, Python will be used to create visualizations to gain insights from the data."

    "The Google Reverse Geocoding API is a service provided by Google Maps that allows you to convert geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into human-readable addresses. It enables you to retrieve detailed location information based on the provided coordinates. When you make a request to the Reverse Geocoding API, it sends back a response in JSON or XML format containing the address components and other relevant details associated with the given coordinates. The API can provide a range of information, including the street address, city, state, postal code, country, and more\n",

    "The dataset consists of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset covers a two-day period and contains a total of 200K+ transactions and 31 columns. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraud transactions accounting for only 0.172% of the total transactions.\n",

    "The dataset primarily includes numeric input variables resulting from a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality concerns, the original features and additional background information about the data are not provided. The dataset includes principal components labeled as V1, V2, â€¦ V28, which are the outcomes of the PCA transformation. The 'Time' and 'Amount' features are exceptions and have not undergone the PCA transformation. The 'Time' feature represents the number of seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction recorded in the dataset. The 'Amount' feature represents the monetary value of each transaction. The 'Amount' feature can be useful, particularly for approaches involving example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. The response variable, labeled as 'Class,' indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).\n",
